substrate
=========

Substrate js - Build true native desktop applications with Javascript.

This is a very early version of this framework. I am still working out the interactions between the UI and Javascript code. I will keep pushing updates as I am working on it. I am sure the API will be changing constantly as I figure out the necessary methods that will be exposed to JS.

If anyone is interested in this new project, feel free to shoot me an email, or hit me up on Twitter @davesters.
